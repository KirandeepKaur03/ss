    <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;font-size: x-large;"> A lowdown on the Best Inverter Batteries and Their Benefits </p>
    If you live in an area where there are regular power cuts, you certainly know what an inverter is. Consequently, you might have an idea about inverter batteries too. You may have come across a million things about inverter batteries that may or may not be true! However, only when you know the types of inverter batteries and online inverter battery price in India can you understand which is the best inverter battery for home use. At Luminous, we offer a comprehensive range of the best inverter batteries and inverter plus battery combo to select from.
    <br><br>
    Let's start with the basics of top inverter batteries by Luminous.
    <br><br>
    <b>What Is an Inverter Battery?</b>
    <br><br>
    Within the life of an inverter,battery plays a critical role. Inverter converts the grid supplied energy into DC power and battery is a device where this DC power is stored. In the event of power outage, inverter draws power from battery and inverts it back to AC form to run all household loads.
    <br><br>
    Based on their plate technology, there are three types of best inverter batteries that we offer:
    <br><br>
    <b>
        1. GEL Batteries
        <br><br>
2. Tubular Plate Batteries
<br><br>
3. Flat Plate Batteries
<br><br>
3. GEL Batteries
<br><br>
    </b>
    Compared to a standard lead-acid battery, lead acid Gel batteries provide a more stable power backup for a longer period. These have a special crisscross gel structure which retains the acid and stops it from settling down. They also have more backup power per cycle in comparison to standard flooded lead acid battery. However because of advanced components inside, GEL batteries are marginally priced higher than standard flooded lead acid battery.
    <br><br>
    <b>
        What are the benefits of GEL batteries?
    </b>
    The greatest advantage of a gel battery is that it is environment friendly and emits minimum harmful gases into the atmosphere, thereby making your home/office a healthier place to live. It is also sealed due to which there is no risk of acid spillage. It is easy to install and maintenance-free. No water top-up is required during the entire lifecycle of these batteries. Lastly, these batteries provide fairly consistent power backup throughout their entire service life, .
    <br><br>
    <b>Other Benefits:</b>
    <br><br>
    • Completely maintenance-free <br><br>

    •Suitable for deep cycle discharge <br><br>
    
    •Very low to no gassing (unless overcharged) <br><br>
    
    •Well-suited for sensitive electronic equipment <br><br>

        Tubular Plate Batteries
    </b>
    A tubular plate Lead acid battery consists of positive and negative plates which are having specific geometric shape. Positive plates of these batteries are having elements of tubular shape, whereas the negative plates are flat shaped.
    <br><br>
    The geometric structure of positive plates is tubular and it retains active chemical components within the inverter battery with extra support. These plates have a tubular support structure around the reactive chemical that ensures the receptive element stays in place. They are known as the best inverter batteries for areas that face prolonged power cuts like tier 2 and 3 metropolitan cities. The best tubular battery for home inverter is generally bigger in size if you compare it to a flat plate battery.
<br><br>
Advanced high-tech filling processes and machines, in addition to the superior performance of tubular plate technology, have made the best tubular battery for inverter more effective and reliable for manufacturers, allowing the inverter battery price to be competitive.
<br><br>
<b>What are the benefits of Tubular Battery?</b>    
A tubular battery for inverter is better equipped and has a longer service life for long power backup needs. This best inverter battery uses less water top ups.
<br><br>
Tubular batteries are more durable than a flat plate battery and usually come with a longer warranty period. The online inverter battery price in India for a tubular battery is marginally than flat plate battery and needs more storage space than a flat plate battery.
<br><br>
Tubular batteries come in different container sizes and should be chosen depending on the space available to store the battery in a home. The best inverter battery can be further categorized into short tubular batteries (ST / TJ) and high tubular batteries (TT).
<br><br>
1. The short tubular battery is significantly smaller but larger in height than a tall tubular battery. Storing and carrying this inverter battery is more convenient.
<br><br>
2. The tall tubular battery is larger in height, but smaller in width than a short tubular battery and a flat plate battery. It offers a slightly longer backup time and is favoured for homes where storage space is not a constraint.
<br><br>
<b>Flat Plate Batteries</b>
<br><br>
One of the most talked-about online batteries for inverter is a flat plate battery. These are the best inverter batteries, for cities with frequent power cuts. If we talk about the plates, both the positive & negative plates of FLAT PLATE battery Is geometrically flat in shape.
<br><br>
<b>What are the benefits of a flat plate battery?</b>
<br><br>
As stated, for areas with very short & frequent power cuts, these batteries are suggested. The inverter battery price is low, which is light on the wallet, but compared to tubular inverter batteries, they have a shorter life span. Such batteries have a higher charging rate and take less time to charge. It usually has a short warranty duration compared to tubular batteries. We have best in class Luminous Inverlast series of flat plate batteries with robust design, excellent charging acceptance, and low water loss. Indeed, in some aspects tubular battery is more efficient, but Luminous flat plate batteries with an enhanced life span make them one of the best inverter batteries for the Indian market. Apart from knowing about the various types of the best inverter battery, it is also vital to understand the importance of battery capacity.
<br><br>
<b>Battery Capacity:</b>
<br><br>
A battery's capacity is the sum of wattage to be expected from a battery during run time. In Ah (Ampere hours), it is measured. Like this, battery capacity is determined [Power (in watts) X back up hours (in hrs.)] / Battery Voltage (in volts) For example, buying a lead acid battery for inverter with a running time of 3 hours and assuming that the normal battery voltage is 12 V would require a battery with a capacity of (400 * 3) / 12 = 100 Ah. Batteries ranging from 100 Ah to 220 Ah are available on the market with different capacities. So how do you decide which one suits your needs best? You can calculate the battery capacity that is perfect for your needs based on the above estimate. Fortunately for you, Luminous has designed a load calculator that uses an intelligent algorithm to decide the optimal power backup requirement for you. For almost all lead acid batteries for inverter, note that the battery's voltage level is 12 V. As the load rises, the inverter's wattage improves accordingly. In multiples of 12V, i.e., 24 V, 36 V, and so on, higher inverter power runs at a higher voltage. 2 batteries of 12 V each are required for a 24 V inverter. It is essential to invest in the best inverter battery because it is the inverter plus battery combo that helps to protect your appliances against power fluctuations during power cuts. So, make an informed decision and buy an inverter battery online in India according to your needs!
