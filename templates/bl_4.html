    A battery is the backbone of an inverter. It is responsible for your inverter's extended efficiency and long service life. Routine battery servicing and maintenance not only ensure optimal performance of your power back-up system, but also ensures safety of your home. Much like any other home device, inverter and its battery require standard maintenance too. For uninterrupted functioning of an inverter battery for home, regular battery checks are a must. We recommended that you get your inverter’s battery checked once in every three months. LUMINOUS range of inverter battery for home and commercial use requires low maintenance as compared to other brands in standard operating conditions. With these tips, you can extend the performance of your inverter’s battery: Please note, battery contains high amount of electric change and also hazardous chemical components, inside. Ensure proper personal safety arrangements during the following activities.
    <br><br>
    <b>1. Check Battery Only When Fully Charged</b>
    <br><br>
    To conduct a maintenance check on inverter battery for home, it needs to be fully charged. For the same, it is necessary to ensure that the battery has been charged for 10-15 hours with a suitable inverter or an external charger before undertaking a battery health check regime. Before examining battery health, the inverter is removed from the front panel and needs detachment from the wall socket too.
    <br><br>
    <b>2. Check the Acid Level</b>
    <br><br>To check the acid level, look at the float indicators. The acid level should be equal in all the cells for proper working of the inverter battery. Open the float indicator & top up the inverter battery with DM water upto the specified limit, if necessary. Ensure batteries are not over filled. Filling up the battery beyond the specified limit may become dangerous for operation. Open the vent plugs/float indications and test the acid colour. The acid should be colourless if the health of the inverter battery is good. Brown or black coloured acid suggests that battery is contaminated or at end of life.
   <br><br>
    <b>3. Clean the Battery Terminal Area</b>
    <br><br>
    Inverter battery produces lead sulphate, which gets deposited at the interconnection region of the battery & inverter (battery terminal) during normal operation. Lead sulphate increases the electrical resistance of current-conducting path and deters current flow from the inverter to the converter. Clean the battery with warm water and a nylon brush if there is any lead sulphate accumulation.
    <br><br>
   <b>4. Keep the Battery Surface Spotless</b>
   <br><br>
   To ascertain the proper functioning of a battery, you should check for any deposition of dirt on its surface. If you find dirt, try to clean it with a dry cloth. This way, you will be able to keep the battery clean
   <br><br>
   <b>5. Damaged Wire Affects Performance</b>
   <br><br>
   Lastly, test the battery wires for any crimp, break, and insulation melt. Damaged or tampered battery wires not only reduce battery output but can raise the risk of short circuits and other dangers in your house.

   In addition to these things, check the inverter’s input power line condition as its functioning gets affected if the mainline power cord is loosely plugged in or if there is no power in the wall socket. In case the mains input fuse is blown, or the input voltage is too high or too low, the inverter battery can face performance issues. Remember when you purchase an inverter battery for home use, it should be kept in a dry, well ventilated area that does not have direct sunlight or heat to ensure safe and proper battery functioning.
